BrainVita game demo


Description:

 There are many balls in a dish. The lattices are full except the middle one. 
 If there are two connected balls and an empty lattice in one direction, 
 you can move the further ball to the lattice, and then the ball next to the lattice will disappear. 
 You should find every qualified ball and clean it. Sometimes there are several places your balls can go, 
 and you should choose an appropriate one so that you can clean more balls. 
 If you can not find any qualified ball any more, game will be over
